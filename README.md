NovusEdge - Investment Firm Management Software

## Description

NovusEdge is an all around investment management software designed for investment firms to manage stock transactions, track portfolio performance, and monitor live market data. It provides users with the ability to execute buy transactions, update portfolio information with real-time stock prices, calculate unrealized profits and losses, and track dividend yields.
